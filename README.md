Author: Yun Gao, Changyuan Li, Gulin Fu

## Description
An analysis of correlation between the weather and crime records in Chicago yielded strong evidence that weather has a positive effect on most types of crime. The analysis is based on weather data and crime data in Chicago from 2001 to 2015. Also, we identify the effect of the storm event on crime rate. To parse the big data of the crime record, Hadoop is used in this project. The result of crime rate in diverse weather conditions is presented the by charts.
